excerpt: It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
  content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is
  that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content
  here, content here', making it look like readable English.

<p>If you're heading to the <a href="#">Future of StoryTelling Summit</a>, I'd love for you to participate in the workshop I’m leading with Dianna Kane. Dianna is a Senior Designer at Medic Mobile, a company using accessible technologies such as SMS to improve healthcare in marginalized communities around the world.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, FreeAssociation has worked with Medic Mobile as their design partner on a number of projects. Through this experience, we've honed a unique set of methods that enable us to more effectively design for low-tech, geographically remote contexts.</p>

 <p>One of these methods is Story-Centered Design, where we utilize storytelling techniques to place the design team into the world of the user. Story-Centered Design has proven to be a fantastic means for employing a human-centered, empathetic approach to areas wrought with social and logistical complexity. We felt it was a relevant skill to share with our storytelling friends at FoST.</p>

<p>Hope to see you there.</p>
